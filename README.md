Soft tissue simulation based on HiflowÂ³

[cite paper please]


## Installation

Download the latest *elasticity* binary for your system:

* [Linux 64bit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CognitionGuidedSurgery/elasticity/master/bin/elasticity.lx64)
* Linux 32bit (not supported)
* Windows (not supported)

You should consider [hf3lint](https://github.com/areku/hf3lint)
for checking the input files for elasticity.

## Input Files

Two input files, one with the simulation setup (hf3), giving information such as input files, material properties, mathematical simulation framework, etc., and the other one with constraints (bcdata.xml), giving information such as pointwise displacement (Dirichlet) and force/pressure (Neumann) boundary conditions.
Each input file is in XML format.
